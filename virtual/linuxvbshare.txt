After the upper command is completed, make a folder on the metal machine. (The one that the computer usually boots up to.)

In the linux VitualBox software settings, go to Devices, Shared Folders, Shared Folders Settings, there click on machine folders to select it.
Then to the right, click new folder and search for the folder that you want to share between the virtual machine and the host machine.
Select the auto mount option, make permanent is also an option as well if it is an option.
(It's your choice on the last option. You can change it later.)

Another way is to go to the settings of the virtual box manager and do the configuration above. 
Settings, Shared Folders, Machine Folder, new folder(buttion on the right side with the + sign).
Select folder, select auto mount, (you can choose on this one, if it's there) make permanent.

In the linux virtualbox terminal, you need too make a folder that will be the mount point that virtualbox will host the shared folder.
Best place is on the Desktop.
Feel free to put it anywhere else.

Command below will make it for you.
***************************************
$sudo mkdir ~/Desktop/share;
***************************************
Now to mount.
***************************************
$sudo mount -t vboxsf metalfolder ~/Desktop/share;
